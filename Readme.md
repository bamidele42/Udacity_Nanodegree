## This repository contain projects for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program
 
- In the first project I demonstrate the flow of data analysis process from questioning, exploring, analyzing and communication data findings.
 
- For the second project I show strong data wrangling skills which involved, gathering, assessing and cleaning data. I showe how to explicitly wrangle data programmatically make it fit for deeper analysis.

 - I applied sound design and data visualization principles to the data analysis process. I choose a dataset and perform an exploratory data analysis on it using Python, then create a presentation plots that convey my findings
